Description: An OBS source service: reformats a spec file to SUSE standard
 This is a source service for openSUSE Build Service.
 .
 This source service is formating the spec file to SUSE standard. The rational
 behind is to make it easier to review spec files from unknown packagers.
 .
 This should be used in "trylocal" mode, so that osc is adapting the existing
 spec file instead of creating a new one.
